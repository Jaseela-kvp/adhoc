            Whether it is an operator sitting high atop a loader or your children riding in their school bus, Our Vehicle Fire Suppression Systems are designed first 
            and foremost to protect human life. Our systems are designed and installed to suppress a fire before it can reach the operator or passenger areas, quickly 
            and efficiently.<br><br>
            City, transit and school bus systems are a critical component to meeting many communities. These vehicles are susceptible to fire for several reasons. 
            They often operate steady for several hours at a time. They use flammable liquids in their normal operation. They also generate heat from their engine 
            components which can ignite these flammable liquids and debris. In many communities transit bus plays a major role in providing daily transit to commuters
             while reducing the vehicle congestion on roads and highways.<br><br>
            The impact of a fire in a city or school bus is wide ranging. Just a few issues surrounding bus fires include passenger safety, costs to city or school, loss 
            of passenger capacity, disruption of traffic and public relations issues.

      </div>
      <p>
        Our automatic systems suppress the fire in its earliest stages before it becomes fully established and spreads into highly combustible areas. As a result, damage
         is limited and equipment down time is held to a minimum.
        The systems offer a unique approach to fire protection of many of the fire prone areas of these vehicles. It detects fire using the proprietary red colored Detection 
        Tubing. This heat sensitive tubing is pressurized and reacts to the heat and radiant energy of a fire by bursting, thus activating the fire suppression system.
        The detection tubing is ideal for fire detection in buses as it tolerates the vibration, dirt, temperature extremes of the environments in which the buses operate. 
        Also, as the systems are pneumatically operated, they require no power from the vehicle to operate and do not place additional strain on the vehicleï¿½s electrical system.

            Gaseous fire suppression systems are gas suppression systems using chemical agents to extinguish a fire. Gaseous fire suppression systems are waterless, deploy quickly 
            and most importantly cleanly without leaving water, particulate or oily residue on high value or irreplaceable assets.
            Ideal for protecting areas where water can seriously damage equipment, gas extinguishing systems are excellent at providing localized fire protection.
            Automatically extinguishing a fire without the need for intervention, gas extinguishing systems are suitable for clean air environments such as server rooms, data centers and telecommunications.

            A central extinguishant control panel monitors the protected environment, and is linked to a dedicated detection release system. 
            Extinguishant discharge is activated through smoke detectors which are located within the protected area, ceiling and floor voids if necessary.
            Early warning of a fire can also be achieved by installing a HSSD (High Sensitivity Smoke Detection) Aspiration system through Ultra Surefire. Potential 
            fires can then be investigated early to prevent unnecessary gas discharge.
            To complement your building fire strategy, gas extinguishing systems can be fully integrated with your building fire detection system for cause and effect.

            Fire sprinkler systems are active fire protection systems designed to protect buildings from the outbreak of fires by sprinkling water over them. 
            The fire sprinkler systems consists of a water supply system, connected to a distribution piping system that are in turn fitted with fire sprinklers 
            that discharge water as a fine spray at the scene of a fire.
            <br><br>Automatic sprinkler systems still remain the most widely used fire protection system today, discharging calculated amounts of water for the 
            risk involved following guidelines expressed in British, European and American Standards.            
            <br><br>Activated when a sprinkler head detects heat from a fire, the sprinkler opens to release water directly over the fire. Pipework feeds from 
            the sprinkler heads run to either the mains water or from a storage tank via a pump.            
            <br><br>Our comprehensive design and installation service of sprinkler systems means that we can support your project from concept to completion. 
            Both property protection or life safety systems are available, backed up by dedicated water supplies including; wet type, dry type, tail end and pre-action.

        <p >
          Foam suppression systems are fire suppression systems using foam to extinguish fires. Foam fire suppression systems are used to form a coherent floating blanket on 
          flammable and combustible liquids to prevent or extinguish fires by excluding air and cooling the fuel. It also prevents re-ignition by suppressing the formation of flammable vapors.
          During a fire, foam extinguishing systems spread large-scale foam blanket through foam pipes, foam monitors, sprinklers or nozzles. The foam is applied on the burning material,
           extinguishes the fire and serves as a deterrent against re-ignition.
          Foam extinguishing systems are suitable for protecting high-risk areas, e.g. due to flammable liquids or plastics. The adjustable low to extremely high foaming option offers an
           optimal extinguishing effect for every type of risk.

            Dry Chemical Powder Fire Suppression Systems are fire suppression systems use dry chemical powder to extinguish a fire. When introduced directly to a fire, 
            dry chemical powder extinguishes flames almost immediately. Dry chemical powder is intended for use in extinguishing fires involving bulk chemical agents and liquefied gases.
            Powder-based systems are stationary fire extinguishing systems. Extinguishing powders are efficient and fast-acting extinguishants. The three-dimensional extinguishing effect
            of the powder cloud is caused by the suffocation effect and the so-called anti-catalytic effect, a chemical intervention into the combustion process.                
            Extinguishing powders mainly consist of non-toxic inorganic salts mixed with waterproofing and pouring agents. They are used in industrial environments for fires with solid, 
            liquid or gaseous substances and for metal fires.
